## Introduction to Generative AI

Generative AI refers to artificial intelligence systems that can create new content, such as text, images, or code. Unlike traditional AI that focuses on classification or prediction, generative AI can produce original outputs based on its training data.

### Key Concepts:
- **Generative Models**: AI models that can create new content
- **Large Language Models (LLMs)**: AI models trained on vast amounts of text data
- **Prompt Engineering**: The art of crafting effective inputs to get desired outputs
- **Fine-tuning**: Customizing pre-trained models for specific tasks

## Understanding Large Language Models (LLMs)

LLMs are the foundation of modern generative AI. They work by:
1. Processing input text (prompts)
2. Understanding context and patterns
3. Generating relevant responses

### Popular LLMs:
- GPT (OpenAI)
- Claude (Anthropic)
- LLaMA (Meta)
- PaLM (Google)

## Getting Started with OpenAI

To use the sample code in this repository:

1. Create an OpenAI account at https://platform.openai.com
2. Generate an API key
3. Create a `.env` file in the project root:
   ```
   OPENAI_API_KEY=your-api-key-here
   ```
4. Install dependencies:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Basic Prompt Engineering

Effective prompts are crucial for getting good results from LLMs. Here are some tips:

1. **Be Specific**: Clearly state what you want
2. **Provide Context**: Give relevant background information
3. **Use Examples**: Show the desired format or style
4. **Iterate**: Refine your prompts based on results

### Example Prompts:
```
# Simple Question
What is artificial intelligence?

# Role-based Prompt
You are a helpful AI assistant. Explain quantum computing in simple terms.

# Structured Prompt
Please provide a brief explanation of machine learning, including:
1. Definition
2. Key concepts
3. Common applications
```

## Sample Code Walkthrough

This repository includes three example scripts:

1. **simple_prompting.py**: Basic prompt examples
2. **chat_completion_example.py**: Interactive chat session
3. **basic_langchain_chain.py**: Simple LangChain implementation

Try running each example to understand different ways to interact with LLMs.
