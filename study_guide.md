# Generative AI Study Guide

## 45-Minute Session Plan

### ⏱️ 0 – 5 min | Topic 1: What is Generative AI?

- **Definition and Core Concepts**: Generative AI refers to AI systems that can create new content (text, images, code, etc.) based on patterns learned from training data. Unlike traditional AI focused on classification or prediction, generative AI produces original outputs.

- **Evolution and Current State**: Generative AI has evolved from simple rule-based systems to sophisticated models like GPT, DALL-E, and Stable Diffusion. These models can now generate human-like text, realistic images, and functional code with increasing accuracy and creativity.

- **Real-world Applications**: ChatGPT for conversation and content creation, Midjourney for image generation, GitHub Copilot for code assistance.

### ⏱️ 5 – 10 min | Topic 2: Deterministic vs Non-deterministic AI

- **Traditional Deterministic Systems**: Traditional software follows deterministic patterns where the same input always produces the same output. These systems operate based on explicit rules and logic, making their behavior predictable and reproducible.

  **Example**: A calculator function that adds two numbers. Given inputs 5 and 3, it will always return 8, regardless of how many times you run it or when you run it.

- **Non-deterministic Nature of GenAI**: Generative AI models are inherently non-deterministic, meaning the same prompt can produce different outputs each time. This variability comes from factors like temperature settings, random sampling, and the probabilistic nature of the underlying neural networks.

  **Example**: Asking ChatGPT to "write a short story about a cat" multiple times will yield different stories each time, even with the exact same prompt. The model might generate different plots, characters, and endings while still adhering to the basic request.

- **Why GenAI Behaves Differently**: The randomness, temperature settings, and probabilistic nature of neural networks create variability in outputs.

### ⏱️ 10 – 15 min | Topic 3: What is an LLM (Large Language Model)?

- **Definition and Capabilities**: LLMs are AI models trained on vast amounts of text data that can understand, generate, and manipulate human language. They can perform tasks like summarization, translation, question answering, and creative writing.

- **How LLMs are Trained**: Training involves processing massive datasets, tokenization (breaking text into manageable pieces), and learning patterns through neural networks with billions of parameters.

- **Use Cases**: Text summarization, code generation, creative writing, translation, and more.

### ⏱️ 15 – 20 min | Topic 4: Popular LLMs in 2025

- **Leading Models**: GPT-4 Turbo, Claude 3, Gemini 1.5, LLaMA 3, Mistral, Cohere, Grok.

- **Differences in Capabilities**: Each model has unique strengths in reasoning, creativity, or specialized domains.

- **Open-source vs Closed**: Comparison of open-source models (like LLaMA, Mistral) versus closed models (like GPT-4, Claude) and their respective advantages.

### ⏱️ 20 – 25 min | Topic 5: Prompt Engineering Basics

- **Role Prompting**: Instructing the model to adopt a specific persona or expertise.

- **Zero/Few-shot Prompting**: Providing examples to guide the model's output format.

- **Tips for Writing Better Prompts**: Be specific, provide context, use clear instructions, and iterate based on results.

- **Examples of Good vs Bad Prompts**: Demonstrating how slight changes in wording can significantly impact output quality.

### ⏱️ 25 – 30 min | Topic 6: Prompt Engineering Techniques

- **Chain-of-Thought (CoT) Prompting**: Encouraging the model to "think aloud" by showing its reasoning process.

- **ReAct (Reason + Act)**: Combining reasoning and action-taking in a structured format.

- **Self-Reflection Prompting**: Asking the model to evaluate and improve its own outputs.

- **Advanced Tools**: LangChain and LlamaIndex for building complex applications with LLMs.

### ⏱️ 30 – 35 min | Topic 7: Agentic Workflows (LLM Agents)

- **What are Agents**: LLMs that can plan and execute actions using tools and external resources.

- **Components**: Planner (strategizes), Memory (retains information), Executor (performs actions), Toolset (accesses external capabilities).

- **Examples**: AutoGPT, LangGraph, OpenAI Agents for autonomous task completion.

### ⏱️ 35 – 40 min | ⚔️ Activity: Prompt Battle

- **Setup**: Split participants into 2 groups or individuals.

- **Goal**: "Write a one-sentence product pitch for a flying car."

- **Process**: Each team creates a prompt to get the best output from ChatGPT.

- **Discussion**: Share results and discuss what made one prompt more effective than another.

- **Learning Outcome**: Reinforces prompt design thinking and demonstrates the impact of prompt engineering.

### ⏱️ 40 – 45 min | ❓ Q&A and Open Discussion

- **Open Floor**: Encourage questions and clarifications from participants.

- **Sharing**: Invite participants to share ideas or GenAI use cases from their work.

- **Recap**: Light recap of key takeaways from the session.
